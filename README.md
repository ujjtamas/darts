# Ironhack project #1
## Online darts game
### About the project
A simple darts game against the computer. One can choose various classic games like 301, 501, and options for double in, double out, length and difficulty.

### How to Play
Fill in your name and select the type and length of game and difficulty. Click 'Game on!'.

Player controls the throw with the mouse, by pointing and clicking. There are randomness added to the throw based on the selected difficulty. The more difficult it is the bigger the uncertainty.

Computer throws automatically leaving 1 second in between each throw. Uncertainty is added for the computer as well.

First one reaching 0 score wins the leg. If the legs won as per the selected game, the player wins the set and a new one begins with the same settings.
